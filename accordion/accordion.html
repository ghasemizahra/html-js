        <h3>What is jQuery?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It
            makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event
            handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API
            that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of
            versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that
            millions of people write JavaScript.

        <h3>What is the difference between jQuery and JavaScript?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            The main difference among the three is that JavaScript is
            client-side in the browser scripting language, whereas jQuery is a
            library (or framework) built with JavaScript. Meanwhile, AJAX is a
            method to immediately update parts of the UI without reloading the
            web pages.

        <h3>Is Ajax and jQuery the same?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            AJAX is a web development technique for making asynchronous calls to
            the server. jQuery is a JavaScript library for designing and make
            some web development tasks easy. It makes it possible to run
            javascript outside of the browser. It works on the browser or
            outside the browser also.

        <h3>Why jQuery?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there, but jQuery
            is probably the most popular, and also the most extendable. Many of
            the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as: Google
            Microsoft IBM Netflix

        <h3>Why learn JavaScript?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            The most obvious reason for learning JavaScript is if you have hopes
            of becoming a web developer. Even if you haven’t got your heart set
            on a tech career, being proficient in this language will enable you
            to build websites from scratch—a pretty useful skill to have in
            today’s job market!
